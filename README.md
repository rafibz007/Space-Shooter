# Space-Shooter

It is a game written in C++ language, using raylib (a library for game developing) as a project for my studies.

Rules are simple:
  - use WSAD to move tour space ship
  - shoot using SPACE to kill enemies and score points
  - avoid enemy ships and their leser shots in order to survice
  - earn highest score as you can!
